The logo represents a sound wave transforming into a written document, symbolizing the core functionality of voice-to-text.

**Dos:**
- Use the white version on dark backgrounds.
- Use the dark slate version on light backgrounds.
- Maintain adequate clear space around the icon.

**Don'ts:**
- Do not stretch or distort the aspect ratio.
- Do not change the core accent color.
- Do not place on busy backgrounds without a scrim.

## UI Design Principles
1.  **Clarity First:** Content should be legible and breathing.
2.  **Native Feel:** The app should blend with the OS window chrome.
3.  **Responsive:** Fluid layout that adapts to window resizing.
4.  **Feedback:** Every user action (recording, deleting) receives immediate visual feedback.
